these programs, I faced them in the code challenge 9 in order to master Python, corrections can be made to optimize my coding,
You can also test your level at this link: https://code9class.com/fr/blog/teste-level-kode-w-ak-enonse-sa-yo
if you know how to code or learn to do it on the same platform
You code, you think better, you code, you think further

1-You have an IP address. You must enter a door(PORT) that is open. You don't have much time to scan all the doors,
but you know the door that is open, it is equal to the sum of all the digits in the IP address, multiplied by the 
first digit in the IP address. Ask the user to type in the IP address, and display the open door NB: All ip addresses 
are separated by periods (.) Example: "127.0.0.1" will return (1 2 7 0 0 1) * 1 = 11 = > So the open door is 11

2-Display OK if the integer N is NOT divisible by 4, display NOK otherwise

3-Ask to use his name. Use your own technique to put this name in title format. This means that the first letter of each
word must be capitalized, and the rest are lowercase. And post the new name.

Example:
"Ayiti se yon BEL PEYI" ap tounen "Ayiti Se Yon Bel Peyi"
